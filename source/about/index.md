## Who am I?

I am a native of northern Anhui, a young master's degree holder, who shuttles between the north and the south, combining the openness of northern people with the delicacy of southern people.

I am a **coder** who loves **technology**. Here, I share my experiences and insights, and I hope to exchange and learn from more people.

I am also an anime enthusiast. From high school (2008) to now, I liked "Naruto" when I was young, and I like "I Shall Seal the Heavens" as I grew up.

In this blog, I will record some of my technical thoughts and my life insights, and so on.

As for the significance of the blog to me: **Recording and Sharing**; **Learning and Improving**.


## My Experience

I have been working in the advertising industry for many years, and I have deep expertise in fields such as machine learning, deep learning, and more. Life is a journey, and whether it's data development, engineering research and development, strategy, algorithms, or other areas, whether it's starting from scratch or taking things from 1 to 99, I have valuable and mature experience. Trust me, you will gain unique experiences and wealth.

## My Mission

I believe that **technology makes life better** is something we should all strive for. My mission is to live out these values through my work and way of life, and to help more people find their own purpose and values.
